# Noum-MayaRenderer
Solution for real-time rendering of a maya scene using an external application.</br>
There's two parts, the first is a plugin for Maya which saves relevant data to a shared memory while working. </br>
The second part is the external application which reads the same data and reconstructs the Maya scene.</br>

It's somewhat limited and can only reconstruct meshes using vertices. </br>
It can also transmit transform operations, materials, and textures.</br>
